RECENT CHANGES

1. added namespace for codebase (mmm)
2.  fix the event ordering issue with new duration encoding (make sure offsets are in proper bar)

TODO

1. make sure status always overrides attributes in piece for tracks that are being resampled (instrument, density).
- check for cases in bar-infilling when there is an ambiguous attribute selected (i.e. a mask over an attribute). This is only allowed in resample mode.

write a function in the encoder base class

a) INFILLING :: if any analytic feature (density, note duration quantile etc) is set to NONE. Then we must pre-process and update corresponding fields. 

b) AUTOREG :: if any analytic feature is set to NONE in autoregressive mode then we let the model determine this value and we never need to pre-process

2. how to support different encoding schemes on different tracks
- just add another field to encoder config



/////

there is a bug when model dim is larger than number of bars in the piece
we have to pad this in the pad_piece_with_status function

note that we also have to fix the issue with adding STANDARD_TRACK in cases where OPZ is being used.
